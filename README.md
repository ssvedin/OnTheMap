Udacity project: On The Map

On The Map is one of the Portfolio Apps for the iOS Developer Nanodegree from Udacity. It was created to showcase implementing networking requests, including GET, POST (including Authentication), PUT and DELETE. It also uses MapKit.

## The App
On The Map has a tab navigation, with a Map View and a List View of students' locations. Each pin annotation on the map, or cell on the list has a (fake) student's name and a link provided. Tapping on the link will open it in Safari.

The App also allows users to add or update their own location, and provide a link to share with other students.

## Requirements
* You need to have Udacity's credentials in order to log in.
* This application was built using Xcode 10.1 and can be run on iOS 12.1 devices or simulators
